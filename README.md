## Loan Document Management System
This project was developed as part of a hands-on course on enterprise-level software system development. The course focused on principles and best practices, including architectural patterns, database modeling, remote deployment, concurrency management, and enterprise data systems.

## Project Overview
The Loan Document Management System provides a complete solution for managing loan document files by:

Retrieving loan files: Using API endpoints to query and request loan documents from an external server that acts as employees uploading files.
Storing files: Organizing and storing retrieved documents into a local file system.
Database integration: Automating the process of moving file metadata and content into a database (via phpMyAdmin) using cron jobs.
Web interface: Enabling users to search for loans based on various criteria (e.g., type, loan number, or date range). Users can view detailed loan information with just a click. Enables employees to also upload pdf files manually.
## Features
Data Management: Robust handling of loan documents, ensuring consistency and organization.
Cron Job Automation: Streamlined workflows for importing data into the database.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple web page for efficient loan searching and retrieval.
Search Capabilities: Query loans by multiple parameters or retrieve all loans with ease.
## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, we gained:

Practical experience with enterprise software development concepts.
A solid understanding of data coherency across multiple RDBMS.
Skills in creating middleware and implementing job scheduling.
Insights into building API integrations and file storage systems.
This project represents an integration of enterprise-level principles into a practical and functional system, demonstrating skills in software architecture, database management, and web application development.
